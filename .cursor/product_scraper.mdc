- Let's build a script for website scraping
- Given a website, scrape all product information and append to the csv file(under `app/resources/`)
- This doc has info on Shopify CSV import: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export/using-csv#adding-multiple-product-images
- CSV filename
  - Let's have this as <brand_name>.csv
  - Create a new one if file doesn't exist. Append if it exists
- SKU name: AbbreviatedBrand-AbbreviatedProduct
    - If brand name is `The divine foods` and product name is `Ulutham Kanji`, SKU name is `TDK-UK`
- Price (in INR):
    - profit_margin_percent = 40
    - customs = 0
    - original_price = scraped price
    - listing_price = original_price + weight_in_kgs * shipping_price_per_kg
						 + customs 
						 + original_price * (profit_margin_percent / 100)
